Welcome to SAMG, an unofficial modding guide for GTA San Andreas. You can find information about optimization, asi loaders, cleo scripts and more!

### :icon-question: What's wrong with the unmodded version?
The vanilla version of SA has a ton of issues like:
- Not being able to play above 1650x1080
- Bugs/glitches that ruin your gameplay if your fps is unlimited.
- Cannot use more than 1GB of RAM.
- Very low quality HUD, Loading screens and Menus.
- and others...

Thanks to a ton of mods, you can fix the game up removing mostly all of those issues!

### :icon-cloud:  Where do I download SA?
You can't buy the original game online since the definitve edition came out. It doesn't exist on Steam/RGL, so the only way you can get it is through the archive websites.
The Miscallenous-C Blog by Junior Djjr has SA on there. Search it on google and download SA from there. This is probably the safest way.
